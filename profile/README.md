## MDAnalysis

The MDAnalysis Community is interested in all facets of **working with data in the computational molecular sciences**. We welcome everyone. **We all follow our [Code of Conduct](https://www.mdanalysis.org/conduct/).**

We maintain a number of projects related to the broader goal of processing and analyzing data in the computational molecular sciences. In particular, [mdanalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis) is a Python library for the analysis of computer simulations of many-body systems at the molecular scale, spanning use cases from interactions of drugs with proteins to novel materials. It is widely used in the scientific community and is written by scientists for scientists. 

You can learn more about MDAnalysis on our home page https://www.mdanalysis.org/ and read regular updates in our [blog](https://www.mdanalysis.org/blog/). You can also follow us on [LinkedIn: MDAnalysis](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mdanalysis/) and BlueSky [@mdanalysis.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/mdanalysis.bsky.social). 

MDAnalysis is a [fiscally sponsored project](https://numfocus.org/project/mdanalysis) of [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to supporting the open source scientific computing community.
